# Test Strategy test

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate your testing skills. To that end we have provided a simple Node JS web application backed by a REST API.

## Running the application

To run the application you have to:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Application features

Currently the application provides a UI and API to filter a database of people by:

- Everyone
- Male
- Female
- Over 30 years old
- Under 30 years old

## Upcoming features

We plan to work on this application and increase our feature set with:

- Combine available filters (e.g.: Male + Over 30 yo)
- Re-implement the UI utilising a design library to make it look nicer
- Refactor the API to accept a collection of filters to apply to the result set

# Requirements

1. Write a test strategy and plan that explains your approach to testing the current API endpoints and UI
2. Write a test strategy and plan to cover the upcoming features development
3. Write a release strategy and plan to deliver the new functionality in an agile manner

## Guidance

- Make sure your plan is as thorough as possible to demonstrate your ability to analyse the â€œhappy path", edge cases, and exception/error paths
- Specify in your approach where you would recommend to write automation tests and when manual testing is appropriate and required
- The release process (development, testing, deployment) is up to you to propose
- You can use any format you like to document this - a Google Doc or Google Sheet is fine and will be easy to share back with us. Feel free to use diagrams and bullet points to support structured test cases - no need to write an essay!

## Most importantly: show us what you can do!
